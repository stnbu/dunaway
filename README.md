The idea is, you post JSON to a REST endpoint and mass-imaging (via PXE) starts happening automatically.

This project got side-tracked. It was useful at one point but was also not sufficiently general to be useful as a stand-alone project.

If you have any interest, drop me a line. I'd like to see it get some use.
